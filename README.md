# Memory-Game
This project consisted on making a memory game using python.

The game generates 9 random colores squares on a 3x3 structure which the player needs to memorize.
Once the player is ready to continue, the game will hide these squares and will ask the player, from left to right, the colors of each square.
Each correct answer will give the player a number of points which will be shown at the end of his turn and his results will be saved on a .txt file.
